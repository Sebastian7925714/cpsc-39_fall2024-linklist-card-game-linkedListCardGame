unfinished attempted at replicating black jack
The deck was suppose to be supplied from linklist but I could not figure out how to make it traverse the nodes. Ai helped construct a large majority, but I was unable to 
guide it correctly.

Currently unplayable, I unfortuantly had to turn in what I have for any points possible. It was too advanced for me
